However, not only is the special edition not capable of achieving 300 mph its production run of nine units now means almost nothing after Bugatti revealed the Chiron Super Sport, a car with the same power, the same top speed, and similar styling to the 300+",

    desc: "Rolls-Royce Phantom has a sheer complication. And there's no wonder that it's both awe-inspiring and, at the same time, slightly terrifying from the reliability point of focus. As a matter of fact, the engine comes with a long lineage, and it is unlikely to cause issues. However, the complicated electronics come with the full weight of BMW Group's expertise! And that's where its reliability can never get questioned! All in all, it's definitely a great investment decision to buy this car.",
